Endlessly expandable base grid with customized containers for organization  

## Planning
### Container Items
- Hard Disks * 3 ✅
- 3D Printing Deburring Tool (❌ error in calculations) 
- Watch
- Charger * 2
- Measurement Tape
- Bike/Car Key
- ID Card

### Container Design
- Parametric
- Interlocking mechanism to adjacent container
    - Inbuilt into container if possible without connector


## Observations
### Gridfinity Base
- Base feels sturdy
- Consumed 55g PLA with 2h 10min of print time
    - Could've gone down on infill & wall loops
- Edges seem to get squished on the base layer

### Container
- Printing takes too long
    - 3 Hrs for Hard Disk & Deburring tool print
- Uneven surface for supports

    - Container not seated flush with base
- Defect on seam line like dots of missing material

- Space for deburring tool miscalculated, tool doesn't fit into the 1x1 base
    - Using it for bedscrapers instead
- Supports too hard to remove while also leaving bad surface finish

- 1x1 container easy to topple
    - Draft needs to be reduced for self locking?
## Future Scope
### Gridfinity Base
- Probably went overboard with wall thickness of 5mm, can be reduced to probably 4mm
    - Can it have impact on adjacent grid connectivity?
- Connector for joining adjacent base (evaluate if needed)
- All supporting structure to be contained by container to enable supportless print (printing from base) for containers

### Container
- Stress concentration safe design at base
- Remove sharp corners to avoid burrs
    - Can lead to improper seating
    - Currently no clearance in draft interacting surfaces
- Support-less printing to be enabled
- Scope for optimising print duration
