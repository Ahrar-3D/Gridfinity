# Gridfinity
Drawer Organizer

## Planned Items
- 2 Hard Disks
- 3D Printing Deburring Tool
- Watch
- Charger
- Measurement Tape

## Issues
- Nothing??

## Observations
### Gridfinity Base
- Base feels sturdy
- Consumed 55g PLA with 2h 10min of print time

## Future Scope
### Gridfinity Base
- Probably went overboard with wall thickness of 5mm, can be reduced to probably 4mm
    - Can it have impact on adjacent grid connectivity?
- Connector for joining adjacent base (truly needed?)
