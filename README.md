# Gridfinity
Drawer Organizer

## Planning
### Container Items
- Hard Disks * 3
- 3D Printing Deburring Tool
- Watch
- Charger * 2
- Measurement Tape
- Bike/Car Key
- ID Card

### Container Design
- Parametric
- Interlocking mechanism to adjacent container
    - Inbuilt into container if possible without connector

## Issues
- Nothing??

## Observations
### Gridfinity Base
- Base feels sturdy
- Consumed 55g PLA with 2h 10min of print time
- Edges seem to get squished on the base layer

## Future Scope
### Gridfinity Base
- Probably went overboard with wall thickness of 5mm, can be reduced to probably 4mm
    - Can it have impact on adjacent grid connectivity?
- Connector for joining adjacent base (truly needed?)
- All supporting structure to be contained for container to enable supportless print (printing from base) for containers

### Container
- Stress concentration safe design at base
- Support-less printing to be enabled
